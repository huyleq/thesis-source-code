I include all the source codes and scripts to reproduce figures in the paper but the Makefile flows are not exact (missing input arguments) and also you would need the data.

Figure 1 is produced with ppRPT.py
Figure 2 plotMud.py
Figure 3 populatePPandRPT.m and velFromRPT.m
Figure 4 scanEta.cpp
Figure 5 openCPS
Figures 6, 7, 11, and 12 rtm.cu
Figures 8, 9, 13, and 14 odcig.cu and OFF2ANG 
Figures 10a,b and 15 semblance.cpp
Figure 10c and 16 sem2histo.py
